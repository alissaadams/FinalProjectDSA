## Setting Up
The data set is very large so it will need to be downloaded separately. This takes only a couple of minutes, below are the instructions on how to do it. 
1. Go to https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/ to download the dataset.

2. Scroll down to Group By Category to find "Appliances", download the meta data.

3. Once the data is downloaded, unzip the file and copy and past it into the "data" folder in the repository and then it is ready for use.
